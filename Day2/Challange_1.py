'''
A teacher has given a project assignment to a class of KEEP SILENCE Students.
She wants to store the marks (out of 100) scored by each student. The marks scored are as mentioned below: 89,78,99,76,77,67,99,98,90
Write a python program to store the marks in a list and perform the following:

1. The teacher forgot to include the marks of one student. Insert 78 at index position, 8 and display the marks of all 10 students.
2. The teacher also wants to know the marks scored by students represented by index positions, 5 and 7.

Identify and display the two marks.
